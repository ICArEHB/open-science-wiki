# ICArEHB Open Science Policy

## Institutional Commitment

ICArEHB researchers are highly aware of the ethical, professional, and scientific responsibilities that come with being stewards of the past. In line with this, we embrace the principles of Open Science, ensuring that research is transparent and reproducible at every stage. This means that our projects undergo peer and community review both before and during the research process. It also means that our methods, software, code, and other outputs are made accessible for the benefit of fellow scientists, the public, and policymakers, helping to shape public policy when necessary. Furthermore, our raw data on humanity's past is archived and made available to everyone, ensuring that it benefits our collective future. Open Science is not only a reflection of our core values as a research institution but also a necessity in ensuring that the knowledge we generate contributes meaningfully to global scientific advancement.

By adopting Open Science principles, ICArEHB aims to:

-   Increase the **visibility and impact** of our research outputs.

-   Enhance **reproducibility and credibility** in the research we conduct.

-   Promote **interdisciplinary and international collaboration**.

-   Ensure that the knowledge and data generated by our researchers are **freely accessible** to the global community.

-   Align with **international standards and funder requirements**, ensuring compliance with Open Science policies from major funding bodies.

## Benefits of Open Science

**Capacity Building**: Open Science promotes a culture of continuous learning and improvement, where researchers are encouraged to share knowledge, tools, and resources with one another, contributing to the overall growth of the center.

### For the Public

**Access to Knowledge**: Open Science makes our research accessible to a global audience, including policymakers, educators, and the public. This ensures that ICArEHB's discoveries can have real-world impacts beyond academia.

**Public Engagement**: Open Science encourages citizen science and public participation in research, promoting greater engagement with archaeology and heritage. By sharing our data and methods, we empower communities to take part in preserving and understanding their cultural heritage.

## Policy overview

The ICArEHB Open Science Policy establishes guidelines for all researchers, students, and collaborators working under the ICArEHB umbrella. The policy covers key aspects of Open Science that all members must adhere to, ensuring that research outputs are accessible, transparent, and reusable.

**Open Access Publishing**:

-   ICArEHB mandates that all research publications resulting from funded or institutional projects must be made openly accessible. Researchers are expected to publish in Gold Open Access journals or deposit accepted manuscripts in institutional or public repositories (Green Open Access).

-   Preprints should be shared whenever possible to accelerate the dissemination of findings.

**Data Management and Sharing**:

-   All ICArEHB research projects must have a Data Management Plan (DMP) (see @sec-dmp). DMPs ensure that data collection, organization, storage, and sharing are handled in a structured and compliant manner.

-   Research data should be deposited in open repositories and follow the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) to promote reuse and long-term preservation.

**Pre-registration of Studies**:

-   ICArEHB encourages researchers to pre-register their studies, specifying hypotheses, methodologies, and analysis plans before data collection begins. Pre-registration increases research transparency and reduces the likelihood of biases such as p-hacking or selective reporting.

-   Pre-registration platforms like OSF Registrations or AsPredicted should be used where applicable.

**Open Methods and Code**:

-   To ensure research reproducibility, ICArEHB requires researchers to openly share their methods and code. By providing detailed methodologies and code in open repositories (e.g., GitHub, Zenodo), researchers enable others to replicate and build upon their work.

-   All shared code must be properly documented and licensed under open licenses, such as MIT or GPL, to facilitate reuse.

**Open Peer Review**:

-   ICArEHB encourages researchers to engage in Open Peer Review whenever possible. Open Peer Review promotes transparency by making review reports and reviewer identities public, fostering a fairer and more constructive peer review process.

**Ethical and Legal Considerations**:

-   ICArEHB's Open Science practices must adhere to ethical standards, including the protection of sensitive data and compliance with privacy regulations like the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr.eu/). Researchers are responsible for ensuring that all shared data is ethically managed, particularly when dealing with human participants or confidential information.

## Compliance Requirements

To ensure that Open Science practices are fully embedded in all research conducted at ICArEHB, compliance with the Open Science Policy is mandatory for all researchers and students. The following steps outline the expectations for compliance:

**Open Access Compliance:**

-   Researchers must publish all journal articles arising from ICArEHB-funded or institutional research in Open Access journals or make the accepted manuscripts available in an open repository.

-   Compliance with funder mandates (e.g., [ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/manage-your-project/open-science), [FCT](https://www.fct.pt/en/sobre/politicas-e-estrategias/politicas-de-ciencia-aberta/)) is critical. Researchers are responsible for ensuring that their publications meet the Open Access requirements of their funding bodies.

-   Trusted repositories like [OSF](https://osf.io/) should be used to deposit manuscripts and supplementary materials.

**Data Management and Sharing Compliance:**

-   A Data Management Plan (DMP) must be available at the start of each research project (see @sec.dmp). The DMP should outline how data will be collected, organized, stored, and shared, and it must follow institutional and funder guidelines.

-   All research data must be stored in an open-access repository upon project completion, with appropriate metadata to ensure it is FAIR-compliant. Researchers must ensure that sensitive data is anonymized or restricted if necessary.

**Pre-registration Compliance:**

-   For hypothesis-driven research, researchers are expected to pre-register their studies to increase research transparency. Pre-registration (see @sec-preregistration) must be done before data collection begins, using platforms such as [OSF Registrations](https://osf.io/registries).

-   ICArEHB will monitor compliance with pre-registration practices, particularly for studies that are likely to undergo peer review in high-impact journals or require significant external funding.

**Open Methods, Protocols, and Code Compliance:**

-   Researchers are required to deposit their research methods, protocols, and code in a public trusted repository upon publication of their findings. Methods, protocols, and code should be documented clearly, allowing other researchers to replicate the study.

-   Compliance will be monitored through the submission of methods, protocols, and code alongside research outputs, and failure to comply may affect future internal funding or project approvals, and individual evaluation.

**Monitoring and Reporting:**

-   ICArEHB will regularly review compliance with its Open Science Policy. When requested, researchers must provide evidence of their Open Access publications, DMPs, pre-registrations, and data/code sharing.

-   ICArEHB annual reports will detail adherence to Open Science practices, including the publication of preprints, the sharing of data and methods, and participation in Open Peer Review.

**Support and Resources:**

-   ICArEHB will provide ongoing support to ensure compliance with Open Science practices. This includes workshops, training sessions, and access to tools such as [Argos](https://argos.openaire.eu/splash/), [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/), [OSF](https://osf.io/), and [Protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/).

-   The ICArEHB Open Science Committee is available to assist researchers in preparing their Data Management Plans, ensuring compliance with funder requirements, and selecting appropriate Open Access journals and repositories.

**Failure to comply with the Open Science Policy may result in:**

-   Restrictions on access to future research funding.

-   Non-compliance being flagged in performance reviews or research assessments.
