# Guidelines {.unnumbered}

Use the following criteria to guide and "evaluate" the Open Science level of a specific study (when available, follow the links for wiki pages on each topic). Most links point to the [Open Science Framework](www.osf.io), but other trusted platforms are available.

## Preparing the study

#### [1. Pre-registration](preregistration.qmd)

Write a pre-registration or registered report and upload it on [OSF Registries](https://osf.io/registries)

#### [2. Data Management Plan](dmp.qmd)

Check/write a data management plan (DMP)

## Conducting the study

#### [3. Data collection protocols](datacollection.qmd)

Use and store understandable and accessible protocols for data collection, including protocols for participant contact, participant instructions, and data handling.

#### [4. Data dictionary](datadictionary.qmd)

Keep a codebook that gives an overview all the different measures and the exact content of data files. This includes information like variable names and labels, measurement levels and values. This can be a template at first and be updated it if changes occur.

#### [5. Logbook](logbook.qmd)

Keep a logbook of all important events that occur during data collection

#### [6. Data storage](datastorage.qmd)

Store your data logically and in a safe place from day 1

#### [7. Scripts](scripts.qmd)

Use understandable and accessible scripts/syntax for data analyses

#### [8. Metadata](metadata.qmd)

Use understandable and accessible Readme to describe research metadata.

## Writing the manuscript

#### [9. Version control](versioncontrol.qmd)

Implement version control when writing your paper/analyzing your data (i.e. using [Github](https://github.com/) or [Datalad](https://www.datalad.org/))

#### [10. Preprints](preprints.qmd)

Upload your final manuscript as a preprint to an official repository such as [OSF Preprints](https://osf.io/preprints/)

#### [11. Peer review](peerreview.qmd)

Submit your final manuscript for peer review using always the Open Access option for that journal

## After publication

#### 12. ICArEHB website

List your published paper on the ICArEHB website by sending the complete reference to our Admin Office

#### 13. Your Social Networks

Write a message on your personal Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.

#### 14. ICArEHB social networks

Write a message for ICArEHB's Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.
