    "text": "2.3 Policy overview\nThe ICArEHB Open Science Policy establishes guidelines for all researchers, students, and collaborators working under the ICArEHB umbrella. The policy covers key aspects of Open Science that all members must adhere to, ensuring that research outputs are accessible, transparent, and reusable.\nOpen Access Publishing:\n\nICArEHB mandates that all research publications resulting from funded or institutional projects must be made openly accessible. Researchers are expected to publish in Gold Open Access journals or deposit accepted manuscripts in institutional or public repositories (Green Open Access).\nPreprints should be shared whenever possible to accelerate the dissemination of findings.\n\nData Management and Sharing:\n\nAll ICArEHB research projects must have a Data Management Plan (DMP) (see Section 4.2). DMPs ensure that data collection, organization, storage, and sharing are handled in a structured and compliant manner.\nResearch data should be deposited in open repositories and follow the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) to promote reuse and long-term preservation.\n\nPre-registration of Studies:\n\nICArEHB encourages researchers to pre-register their studies, specifying hypotheses, methodologies, and analysis plans before data collection begins. Pre-registration increases research transparency and reduces the likelihood of biases such as p-hacking or selective reporting.\nPre-registration platforms like OSF Registrations or AsPredicted should be used where applicable.\n\nOpen Methods and Code:\n\nTo ensure research reproducibility, ICArEHB requires researchers to openly share their methods and code. By providing detailed methodologies and code in open repositories (e.g., GitHub, Zenodo), researchers enable others to replicate and build upon their work.\nAll shared code must be properly documented and licensed under open licenses, such as MIT or GPL, to facilitate reuse.\n\nOpen Peer Review:\n\nICArEHB encourages researchers to engage in Open Peer Review whenever possible. Open Peer Review promotes transparency by making review reports and reviewer identities public, fostering a fairer and more constructive peer review process.\n\nEthical and Legal Considerations:\n\nICArEHB’s Open Science practices must adhere to ethical standards, including the protection of sensitive data and compliance with privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation. Researchers are responsible for ensuring that all shared data is ethically managed, particularly when dealing with human participants or confidential information.",

    "text": "2.4 Compliance Requirements\nTo ensure that Open Science practices are fully embedded in all research conducted at ICArEHB, compliance with the Open Science Policy is mandatory for all researchers and students. The following steps outline the expectations for compliance:\nOpen Access Compliance:\n\nResearchers must publish all journal articles arising from ICArEHB-funded or institutional research in Open Access journals or make the accepted manuscripts available in an open repository.\nCompliance with funder mandates (e.g., ERC, FCT) is critical. Researchers are responsible for ensuring that their publications meet the Open Access requirements of their funding bodies.\nTrusted repositories like OSF should be used to deposit manuscripts and supplementary materials.\n\nData Management and Sharing Compliance:\n\nA Data Management Plan (DMP) must be available at the start of each research project (see @sec.dmp). The DMP should outline how data will be collected, organized, stored, and shared, and it must follow institutional and funder guidelines.\nAll research data must be stored in an open-access repository upon project completion, with appropriate metadata to ensure it is FAIR-compliant. Researchers must ensure that sensitive data is anonymized or restricted if necessary.\n\nPre-registration Compliance:\n\nFor hypothesis-driven research, researchers are expected to pre-register their studies to increase research transparency. Pre-registration (see Chapter 5) must be done before data collection begins, using platforms such as OSF Registrations.\nICArEHB will monitor compliance with pre-registration practices, particularly for studies that are likely to undergo peer review in high-impact journals or require significant external funding.\n\nOpen Methods, Protocols, and Code Compliance:\n\nResearchers are required to deposit their research methods, protocols, and code in a public trusted repository upon publication of their findings. Methods, protocols, and code should be documented clearly, allowing other researchers to replicate the study.\nCompliance will be monitored through the submission of methods, protocols, and code alongside research outputs, and failure to comply may affect future internal funding or project approvals, and individual evaluation.\n\nMonitoring and Reporting:\n\nICArEHB will regularly review compliance with its Open Science Policy. When requested, researchers must provide evidence of their Open Access publications, DMPs, pre-registrations, and data/code sharing.\nICArEHB annual reports will detail adherence to Open Science practices, including the publication of preprints, the sharing of data and methods, and participation in Open Peer Review.\n\nSupport and Resources:\n\nICArEHB will provide ongoing support to ensure compliance with Open Science practices. This includes workshops, training sessions, and access to tools such as Argos, DMPTool, OSF, and Protocols.io.\nThe ICArEHB Open Science Committee is available to assist researchers in preparing their Data Management Plans, ensuring compliance with funder requirements, and selecting appropriate Open Access journals and repositories.\n\nFailure to comply with the Open Science Policy may result in:\n\nRestrictions on access to future research funding.\nNon-compliance being flagged in performance reviews or research assessments.",

ICArEHB encourages the use of preprints to accelerate the sharing of knowledge and increase the visibility of ongoing research.\nRapid Dissemination\nPreprints allow researchers to share their work immediately after completing the manuscript, often months before formal publication. This promotes early access to important findings, lead to early citations, and allows for early feedback from peers, which can improve the manuscript before submission to a journal.\nPreprint Servers\nResearchers can submit preprints to open-access repositories and preprint servers, such as OSF Preprints, arXiv, bioRxiv, or SoArXiv. These platforms make research accessible to a broad audience while providing a DOI for citation purposes.\nCompliance\nMany journals allow authors to post preprints without affecting the submission process.

Look for journals indexed in major databases like Scopus or Web of Science.\nVerify that the journal is not a predatory journal. Use resources such as DOAJ (Directory of Open Access Journals) and Think. Check. Submit. to evaluate journal credibility.\n\nScope and Audience:\n\nEnsure that the journal’s scope aligns with your research focus and that it reaches your intended audience.\nConsider interdisciplinary journals if your research bridges multiple fields.\n\nOpen Access Policies:\n\nConfirm whether the journal offers Gold or Green Open Access options. For Green Open Access, check the length of the embargo period (if any).\nEnsure that the journal allows the deposit of preprints or accepted manuscripts in open-access repositories if opting for Green Open Access.\nHere are some links for the main Archaeology and Human Evolution journals Open Access Policies:\n\nJournal of Archaeological Science\nJournal of Human Evolution\nNature Ecology and Evolution\nPNAS\nQuaternary Science Reviews\nScientific Reports\nJournal of Archaeological Science: Reports\nAnthropological and Archaeological Sciences\n\n\nLicensing:\n\nOpen Access journals typically use Creative Commons (CC) licenses. Make sure the license meets your needs for sharing and reusing content. CC-BY (attribution) is the most common license, allowing others to share and adapt the work as long as the original author is credited.\nOther licenses, such as CC-BY-NC (non-commercial), can be used if you want to restrict commercial use.\n\nPublication Speed:\n\nSome Open Access journals have shorter publication times due to streamlined processes. If rapid dissemination is important, factor in the journal’s average time from submission to publication.",

    "text": "3.5 Funding APCs\nFor Gold Open Access, most journals require an Article Processing Charge (APC) to cover the cost of making the article freely available. ICArEHB supports its researchers in navigating APC funding through the following:\nInstitutional Funding:\n\nICArEHB researchers may have access to institutional funds or agreements that cover or subsidize APCs for certain Open Access journals.\nCheck with the ICArEHB Open Science Committee to see if there are funds available for APC support or if there are existing agreements with Open Access publishers that reduce APC costs (see FCT Agreements below).\n\nFunder Support:\n\nMany research funders, particularly under Plan S, provide grants or support for covering APCs. Researchers should consult their funder’s Open Access policy to confirm eligibility for APC funding.\nIn cases where the funder covers APCs, ensure that you are adhering to their guidelines for Open Access publishing (e.g., immediate Open Access and use of specific repositories).\n\nFCT Agreements\n\nElsevier and Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) have established an agreement to support authors in Portugal who wish to publish open access. When publishing in eligible hybrid journals, authors do not have to pay an article publishing charge (APC). The cost of publishing open access is covered under the terms of the agreement. Please note that the number of APCs included under the agreement is fixed and will be allocated based on date of acceptance. See more info here.\nUAlg is also participating in the agreement between Springer Nature and FCT/FCCN/b-on consortium, meaning that corresponding authors are eligible to publish their articles open access with fees covered. The agreement includes hybrid journals across the Springer and Adis portfolios. See more info here.\n\nERC Policy\n\nIf you publish in a full open access journal or book, or on a full open access publishing platform, publishing fees are eligible costs if incurred during the lifetime of your project and in line with the provisions of your grant agreement.\nIf you publish in a subscription or hybrid journal, in a book for which some parts are not open access, or on a publishing platform that does not provide all of its scholarly content in open access fees of any kind are not eligible costs for the ERC.\nSee more info here.\n\nWaivers and Discounts:\n\nSome Open Access journals offer APC waivers or discounts, particularly for researchers from low-income institutions or countries. Even if ICArEHB has sufficient resources, it is worth inquiring about waivers.\n\nAPC Transparency:\n\nMake sure the journal’s APC is transparently listed on its website, and avoid journals that are unclear about APC costs. APCs can range from a few hundred to several thousand euros depending on the journal.",

    "text": "4.5 Metadata\nMetadata refers to data that describes other data. In other words, it’s information about the content, context, quality, and other characteristics of a dataset. Metadata can include details such as the dataset’s title, author, date created, variable definitions, and data format.\nMetadata is crucial for achieving FAIR data, which stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Without appropriate metadata, it can be difficult or impossible to find, understand, or effectively use a dataset. For example, if a researcher wants to locate data on a particular topic, they may rely on metadata to search for and identify relevant datasets. Similarly, metadata can help ensure that data are properly documented, formatted, and described, facilitating their use by other researchers. Metadata plays a critical role in enhancing the discoverability, usability, and overall value of research data.\n\nExamples of research metadata\n\nA project readme containing the information below. Often in a readme.txt. Find an example template here or use the information below:\n\nCreator (PI): name and affiliation of PI\nTitle: project title\nFunding sources: names of funders, incl. grant numbers and related acknowledgements\nData collector/producer: who is responsible for data collection + date and location of data production\nDescription: project description, incl. relevant publications\nSample and sampling procedures: target population and methods to sample it (or link to document describing this), retention rates for longitudinal studies\nCoverage: topics, time period and location covered\nSource: if relevant, citations to original source from which data were obtained\n\nMetadata for a specific data file, containing, for example, file description, data format, relationship with other files, date of creation and versioning information, etc. This can be a readme.txt or other filetypes, such as nameofdatafile.json or nameofdatafile.xml\nA codebook (data dictionary), which specifies what all variables in your dataset mean.\n\nQuestion wording or meaning\nVariable text: question text or item number\nRespondent: who was asked the question?\nMeaning of codes: interpretation of the codes assigned to each variable\nMissing data codes, e.g., 999\nSummary statistics for both valid and missing cases\nImputation and editing: identify data that have been estimated or extensively edited\nConstructed and weight variables: how were they constructed\nLocation in the data file: field or column location, if relevant\nVariable groupings: if you categorize variables into conceptual groupings\n\nMetadata in systems, such as a data repository. This type of metadata is often enforced and interoperable so that you don’t have to manually create this type of metadata. The OSF plataform provides their own metadata profile.\n\n\n\nMetadata standards\nMetadata standards refer to the frameworks that provide guidelines for the metadata fields, defining the formatting of metadata fields to make them machine-readable and interoperable. An extensive range of metadata standards is available, varying across different disciplines. For the social sciences, the most widely known metadata standards are Dublin Core and Data Documentation Initiative (DDI). Dublin Core consists of basic elements for describing networked resources, such as Title, Creator, Subject, Description, Publisher, Contributor, Date, Type, Format, and Identifier, among others (check this metadata file generator to see all the elements). On the other hand, DDI is commonly used in social, behavioral, economic, and health sciences, including CESSDA (Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives). Researchers may not always need to work directly with these standards, but it is important to understand that different repositories may adopt different standards. More metadata standards can be found here.",

    "text": "4.6 Licensing data\nLicensing is a crucial aspect of Open Science that defines how others can access, use, and share your research data. Properly licensing your data ensures that it can be reused in a way that aligns with your preferences while adhering to legal and ethical standards. This section explains how to choose an appropriate license for your data and why licensing is critical for transparency, collaboration, and reproducibility.\nWhen research data are made openly accessible, licensing helps clarify the terms under which the data can be used, reused, and redistributed. Without a clear license, potential users may be uncertain about their rights to use the data, limiting its reuse and impact.\nLicensing your data ensures:\nLegal clarity: It defines the rights and restrictions on data use, helping to avoid legal disputes.\nOpen collaboration: A well-chosen license encourages collaboration by making it clear that others can freely use the data for further research, while respecting the terms you set.\nAttribution: Licensing often includes provisions for crediting the original data creators, ensuring that you receive recognition for your work.\nConsistency with Open Science principles: Licensing promotes transparency and accessibility, key pillars of Open Science. \n\nTypes of Data Licenses\nThere are several open licenses that researchers can use to make their data openly available while retaining control over how it is reused. ICArEHB recommends the use of Creative Commons (CC) licenses, which are widely recognized and easily understood.\nCC0 (Public Domain Dedication) By applying a CC0 license, you waive all copyright and related rights to your data, effectively placing it in the public domain. This allows others to use, modify, and distribute the data without restriction.\nCC BY (Attribution) A CC BY license allows others to use, modify, and distribute your data as long as they provide proper attribution to the original creator. This license encourages reuse while ensuring that you receive credit for your work.\nCC BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike) CC BY-SA is similar to CC BY, but it includes a “ShareAlike” clause that requires anyone who modifies or builds upon the data to share the derivative work under the same license.\nCC BY-NC (Attribution-NonCommercial) CC BY-NC allows others to use, modify, and distribute your data, but only for non-commercial purposes. Commercial reuse is prohibited unless additional permissions are granted by the data creator.",

This method increases the credibility and transparency of research by making clear what the researcher intends to do before seeing the data.\nKey elements of pre-registration include:\nResearch Questions: Clearly defining the research questions that will be addressed.\nHypotheses: Specifying the hypotheses that will be tested.\nStudy Design and Methods: Providing a detailed description of the study design, including the population, sample size, randomization procedures, and planned measurements.\nAnalysis Plan: Outlining the statistical analyses or qualitative methods that will be used to test the hypotheses.By pre-registering these components, researchers create a permanent, time-stamped record that can later be compared to the final study report to assess the fidelity of the research process.\n\nPre-Registration vs. Registration\nIt is important to distinguish between pre-registration and registration:\nPre-registration: This occurs before data collection begins. It documents hypotheses, methods, and planned analyses, ensuring that researchers commit to a specific analysis plan upfront.\nRegistration: This happens after the study is completed but before the results are published. Registration involves documenting key details about the study and ensuring that the results are accessible to the public, even if they are not published in a traditional journal.
