# Tools and Resources for Open Science

## Approved Tools and Platforms

ICArEHB recommends and supports a range of Open Science tools and platforms to ensure that research outputs - data, protocols, methods, code, and publications - are openly accessible, reproducible, and reusable. These platforms facilitate various aspects of the research lifecycle, from study planning and data management to publication and peer review.

[**OSF (Open Science Framework)**](https://osf.io/)**:** OSF is the preferred platform at ICArEHB for managing and sharing research projects, data, and preprints. It provides a secure and flexible environment where researchers can store files, collaborate with colleagues, and share their work openly. Key features:

-   Data storage and management.

-   Project collaboration and version control.

-   Provides DOI

-   Preprint hosting and study pre-registration.

-   Integration with other tools like GitHub and Cloud Services for seamless workflows.

-   OSF is particularly useful for multi-phase research projects, where different outputs - such as data, code, and preprints - can be linked together and accessed in one place.

[**Protocols.io**](https://www.protocols.io/)**:** Protocols.io is the recommended platform for sharing detailed research protocols, enabling transparency in experimental and methodological practices. Key features:

-   Step-by-step protocol sharing for laboratory, field, and computational methods.

-   Protocol versioning and updates, ensuring reproducibility.

-   Collaborative features for co-developing protocols with colleagues.

-   Researchers can use Protocols.io to share methodologies and ensure that others can replicate or build on their experiments.

[**GitHub**](https://github.com/) and [**GitLab**](https://about.gitlab.com/)**:** Widely used for sharing and collaborating on code, GitHub and GitLab offer robust version control and integration with platforms like OSF for long-term preservation.

[**Zenodo**](https://zenodo.org/)**:** Ideal for sharing datasets, software, and publications. Zenodo provides DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers), ensuring that shared materials are citable and accessible.

[**Figshare**](https://figshare.com/)**:** A platform for storing and sharing datasets, figures, and other research outputs. Figshare allows for easy data sharing and citation.

## Templates and Forms

To streamline the adoption of Open Science practices, ICArEHB provides templates and forms that guide researchers through essential processes like data management, pre-registration, and protocol development. These resources help ensure compliance with funder and institutional requirements while promoting best practices.

**Data Management Plan (DMP) Templates:**

-   [FCT DMP Template](https://myfct.fct.pt/LibDocument/DocumentPatterns.FileDisplay.aspx?EcrypDoctId=omRid7suIkRYq%2BIqLH1qkQ%3D%3D): A template designed to help researchers create a Data Management Plan that complies with FCT (Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia) guidelines, ensuring proper planning for data collection, storage, and sharing.

-   [ERC DMP Template](https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/ERC-Data-Management-Plan.docx): A template aligned with European Research Council requirements, ensuring that research data management practices meet European standards.

**OSF Project Templates**

To use templates please follow the OSF instructions on how to [create a project from template](https://help.osf.io/article/254-create-a-project-from-a-template).

-   [ICArEHB Article Template](https://osf.io/ygkhp/)

-   [Course Management Template](https://osf.io/rtsjq/)

-   [Research Group Management Template](https://osf.io/5mk6w/)

-   [Electronic Lab Notebook Template](https://osf.io/ptdqx/)

-   [Research Teams Coordination Template](https://osf.io/q9sy4/)

**Pre-Registration Forms**

-   Templates for pre-registration can be found on [OSF](https://osf.io/zab38/wiki/home/). These forms help researchers outline their research hypotheses, study design, and analysis plan before data collection, increasing transparency and preventing practices like p-hacking.

**Protocol Templates**

-   Protocols.io Templates: These templates guide researchers in creating clear, detailed protocols that include step-by-step instructions for experiments, fieldwork, or data analysis.

**Metadata Templates**

-   [Readme Metadata Template](https://cornell.app.box.com/v/ReadmeTemplate)

-   [Dublin Core Metadata Generator](https://nsteffel.github.io/dublin_core_generator/generator_nq.html)

**Ethics and Consent Forms**

-   Templates for informed consent, anonymization protocols, and data protection, ensuring that research involving human subjects complies with legal and ethical standards (e.g., GDPR compliance).
