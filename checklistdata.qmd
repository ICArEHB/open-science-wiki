## ðŸ“‹ Checklist for Data Sharing {.unnumbered}

Before sharing your research data, use the following checklist to ensure that you are following ICArEHB's Data Management and Sharing policies:

**Data Management Plan:**

-   [ ] Have I completed a DMP that outlines my approach to data collection, storage, sharing, and preservation?

-   [ ] Is my DMP compliant with institutional and funder requirements?

**FAIR Principles:**

-   [ ] Are my data findable, with clear metadata and a DOI or other unique identifier?
-   [ ] Have I deposited my data in a trusted repository where they are accessible to others?
-   [ ] Are my data formatted using standard protocols and described with standard vocabularies to ensure interoperability?
-   [ ] Are my data accompanied by a clear, open license (e.g., CC-BY) that supports reuse?

**Data Repositories:**

-   [ ] Have I selected a suitable repository for long-term preservation and public access to my data (e.g., OSF, Zenodo)?

-   [ ] Have I checked whether my repository complies with funder and institutional mandates?

**Ethical and Legal Considerations:**

-   [ ] Have I obtained informed consent from participants for data sharing and reuse?

-   [ ] Have I anonymized any sensitive data to protect the privacy of participants, in compliance with GDPR?

-   [ ] Have I ensured that my data do not infringe on any intellectual property rights?

**Data Accessibility:**

-   [ ] Are my data available for reuse immediately after publication, or is there an embargo period?

-   [ ] If there are restrictions on data access, have I clearly documented the reasons (e.g., proprietary or ethical concerns)?
