# Data Management and Sharing

## Policy on Data Management

ICArEHB is committed to ensuring that all research data generated by its members are managed according to best practices, preserved for the long term, and made available for reuse whenever possible. Research data must be managed in line with institutional policies, funder requirements, and legal and ethical obligations.

**Data Management Plan (DMP) Requirement**

All research projects at ICArEHB must have a DMP in place from the project's inception. This ensures that data collection, organization, and sharing are planned according to recognized standards.

**Open Data Mandate**

Researchers are required to share their research data in a public repository unless there are legal, ethical, or proprietary restrictions that prevent open access. Data should be made available as soon as possible, typically upon publication of the corresponding research article.

**Long-Term Preservation**

Data generated by ICArEHB researchers must be preserved in a secure and sustainable manner, ensuring long-term accessibility for future research.

**FAIR Principles Compliance**

All data management practices must adhere to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), ensuring that research data can be easily located, accessed, and reused by others.

## Data Management Plans (DMPs) {#sec-dmp}

A data management plan (DMP) is a document that outlines how data will be collected, organized, stored, preserved, and shared during a research project. A DMP is usually required by funding agencies, publishers, or institutions as a way to ensure that research data are managed appropriately and meet legal, ethical, and practical standards.

### What are the main components of a DMP?

The main components of a DMP may include:

-   Description of the data: What type of data will be collected or generated, and how will they be structured?

-   Data collection methods: How will the data be collected (e.g., surveys, experiments, observations), and what tools or equipment will be used?

-   Data organization and documentation: How will the data be named, labeled, and organized to ensure consistency and usability?

-   Data storage and backup: Where and how will the data be stored (e.g., local servers, cloud-based platforms), and how often will they be backed up?

-   Data sharing and reuse: Who will have access to the data, under what conditions, and for what purposes?

-   Data retention and preservation: How long will the data be kept, and how will they be preserved and made accessible after the end of the project?

### General steps to write a DMP

-   Identify the key data types and formats you will collect or generate during your research project.

-   Determine how you will organize and store the data. Consider factors such as security, backup, and accessibility.

-   Decide how you will manage any ethical or legal issues related to your data. This may involve obtaining informed consent from participants, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, or addressing intellectual property rights.

-   Establish guidelines for documenting your data. This may include creating metadata, labeling your files, and maintaining a data dictionary.

-   Develop a plan for sharing your data. Consider what data should be shared, with whom, and under what conditions.

-   Develop a plan for preserving your data after completing your project. Consider how long you will need to keep the data and how you will ensure that it remains accessible and usable.

Some funding agencies, institutions, or publishers may provide templates or guidelines for writing a DMP. Additionally, there are several online tools available, such as the [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/), [DataOne](https://www.dataone.org/), or [Argos](https://argos.openaire.eu/home) that can help guide you through the process of creating a DMP tailored to your specific needs.

When writing your DMP, it is important to be as specific as possible and to consider all aspects of your data management strategy. Consult with colleagues or data management experts if you need guidance or feedback.

## FAIR Principles

The FAIR principles are internationally recognized standards for data management that ensure research data are organized and shared in a way that maximizes their potential for reuse. All data generated at ICArEHB must comply with these principles:

**Findable:**

-   Data should be easily found by both humans and machines. This requires detailed metadata, unique identifiers (e.g., DOIs), and inclusion in searchable repositories.Use clear and consistent file naming conventions.

-   Ensure metadata are complete and standardized.

**Accessible:**

-   Data should be accessible and retrievable by authorized users, with clear guidelines on how to access them.

-   Deposit data in trusted open-access repositories.

-   Clearly define any access restrictions due to privacy or proprietary concerns.

**Interoperable:**

-   Data should be formatted and structured in ways that allow them to be integrated with other datasets and used across different platforms.

-   Use open, standardized formats and protocols.

-   Ensure data are described using standard vocabularies or ontologies.

**Reusable:**

-   Data should be well-documented and licensed so that they can be reused in future research.Include detailed documentation (metadata, protocols, workflows).

-   Use appropriate licenses, such as CC-BY or CC0, to clarify the conditions for reuse.

## Data Repositories

Research data must be stored in a secure, trusted repository that provides long-term access and preservation. ICArEHB researchers should deposit their data in reputable open-access repositories that support FAIR data management.

Recommended repositories include:

**OSF (Open Science Framework):** A widely used platform that supports open data sharing and research collaboration. OSF provides unique DOIs and integrates with various tools for research management.

**Zenodo:** An open-access repository developed by CERN. Zenodo allows researchers to share datasets, software, and other research outputs with unique identifiers.

**Domain-Specific Repositories:** For certain types of data, it may be appropriate to use a specialized repository (e.g., [PANGAEA](https://www.pangaea.de/) for earth and environmental science data, or [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) for genomic data).\

## Metadata

Metadata refers to data that describes other data. In other words, it's information about the content, context, quality, and other characteristics of a dataset. Metadata can include details such as the dataset's title, author, date created, variable definitions, and data format.

Metadata is crucial for achieving FAIR data, which stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Without appropriate metadata, it can be difficult or impossible to find, understand, or effectively use a dataset. For example, if a researcher wants to locate data on a particular topic, they may rely on metadata to search for and identify relevant datasets. Similarly, metadata can help ensure that data are properly documented, formatted, and described, facilitating their use by other researchers. Metadata plays a critical role in enhancing the discoverability, usability, and overall value of research data.

### Examples of research metadata

-   A project readme containing the information below. Often in a readme.txt. Find an example [template here](https://cornell.app.box.com/v/ReadmeTemplate) or use the information below:

    -   **Creator** (PI): name and affiliation of PI

    -   **Title**: project title

    -   **Funding sources**: names of funders, incl. grant numbers and related acknowledgements

    -   **Data collector/producer**: who is responsible for data collection + date and location of data production

    -   **Description**: project description, incl. relevant publications

    -   **Sample and sampling procedures**: target population and methods to sample it (or link to document describing this), retention rates for longitudinal studies

    -   **Coverage**: topics, time period and location covered

    -   **Source**: if relevant, citations to original source from which data were obtained

-   Metadata for a specific data file, containing, for example, file description, data format, relationship with other files, date of creation and versioning information, etc. This can be a readme.txt or other filetypes, such as nameofdatafile.json or nameofdatafile.xml

-   A codebook (data dictionary), which specifies what all variables in your dataset mean.

    -   **Question wording** or **meaning**

    -   **Variable text**: question text or item number

    -   **Respondent**: who was asked the question?

    -   **Meaning of codes**: interpretation of the codes assigned to each variable

    -   **Missing data codes**, e.g., 999

    -   **Summary statistics** for both valid and missing cases

    -   **Imputation and editing**: identify data that have been estimated or extensively edited

    -   **Constructed and weight variables**: how were they constructed

    -   **Location in the data file**: field or column location, if relevant

    -   **Variable groupings**: if you categorize variables into conceptual groupings

-   Metadata in systems, such as a data repository. This type of metadata is often enforced and interoperable so that you don't have to manually create this type of metadata. The OSF plataform provides their own [metadata profile](https://help.osf.io/article/573-osf-metadata-profile).

### Metadata standards

Metadata standards refer to the frameworks that provide guidelines for the metadata fields, defining the formatting of metadata fields to make them machine-readable and interoperable. An extensive range of metadata standards is available, varying across different disciplines. For the social sciences, the most widely known metadata standards are [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/) and [Data Documentation Initiative](https://ddialliance.org/) (DDI). Dublin Core consists of basic elements for describing networked resources, such as Title, Creator, Subject, Description, Publisher, Contributor, Date, Type, Format, and Identifier, among others (check this [metadata file generator](https://nsteffel.github.io/dublin_core_generator/generator_nq.html) to see all the elements). On the other hand, DDI is commonly used in social, behavioral, economic, and health sciences, including [CESSDA](https://www.cessda.eu/) (Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives). Researchers may not always need to work directly with these standards, but it is important to understand that different repositories may adopt different standards. More metadata standards can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/3543756#.ZAkCnuxUmrO).

## Licensing data

Licensing is a crucial aspect of Open Science that defines how others can access, use, and share your research data. Properly licensing your data ensures that it can be reused in a way that aligns with your preferences while adhering to legal and ethical standards. This section explains how to choose an appropriate license for your data and why licensing is critical for transparency, collaboration, and reproducibility.

When research data are made openly accessible, licensing helps clarify the terms under which the data can be used, reused, and redistributed. Without a clear license, potential users may be uncertain about their rights to use the data, limiting its reuse and impact.

Licensing your data ensures:

**Legal clarity**: It defines the rights and restrictions on data use, helping to avoid legal disputes.

**Open collaboration**: A well-chosen license encourages collaboration by making it clear that others can freely use the data for further research, while respecting the terms you set.

**Attribution**: Licensing often includes provisions for crediting the original data creators, ensuring that you receive recognition for your work.

**Consistency with Open Science principles**: Licensing promotes transparency and accessibility, key pillars of Open Science. 

### Types of Data Licenses

There are several open licenses that researchers can use to make their data openly available while retaining control over how it is reused. ICArEHB recommends the use of Creative Commons (CC) licenses, which are widely recognized and easily understood.

**CC0 (Public Domain Dedication)** By applying a CC0 license, you waive all copyright and related rights to your data, effectively placing it in the public domain. This allows others to use, modify, and distribute the data without restriction.

**CC BY (Attribution)** A CC BY license allows others to use, modify, and distribute your data as long as they provide proper attribution to the original creator. This license encourages reuse while ensuring that you receive credit for your work.

**CC BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike)** CC BY-SA is similar to CC BY, but it includes a "ShareAlike" clause that requires anyone who modifies or builds upon the data to share the derivative work under the same license.

**CC BY-NC (Attribution-NonCommercial)** CC BY-NC allows others to use, modify, and distribute your data, but only for non-commercial purposes. Commercial reuse is prohibited unless additional permissions are granted by the data creator.

## Ethics and Legal Compliance

Research data management must comply with all relevant ethical and legal standards, particularly when dealing with sensitive or personal data. ICArEHB researchers are responsible for ensuring that their data management and sharing practices adhere to the following principles.

**Informed Consent**

If the data involve human participants, researchers must ensure that informed consent is obtained for data collection, storage, and sharing. Consent forms should specify how data will be used and shared, including potential reuses.

**Data Anonymization**

When sharing personal or sensitive data, researchers must anonymize the data to protect the privacy of participants. Anonymization should be irreversible and compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**Intellectual Property Rights**

Researchers must respect intellectual property rights and ensure that data are shared in a way that does not violate any copyrights, patents, or proprietary agreements.

**Data Licensing**

Data should be shared with a clear license, such as Creative Commons, that specifies how they can be used and reused by others. Researchers should choose licenses that align with Open Science principles (e.g., CC-BY, CC0).

**Funder and Institutional Requirements**

ICArEHB researchers must comply with any specific data management and sharing requirements set by their funding agencies, institutions, or collaborators. Researchers should check these requirements early in the project to ensure compliance.
