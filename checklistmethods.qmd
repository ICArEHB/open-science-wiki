# ðŸ“‹ Checklist for Sharing Methods, Protocols, and Code {.unnumbered}

Before sharing your methods, protocols, and code, use the following checklist to ensure that they meet ICArEHB's standards for Open Science:

**Protocol Documentation:**

-   [ ] Have I provided a detailed, step-by-step guide to all experimental procedures, data collection methods, and analysis techniques?

-   [ ] Are the materials, equipment, and conditions clearly specified to ensure replicability?

**Code Documentation:**

-   [ ] Have I included a README file that explains the purpose of the code, how to install it, and how to use it?

-   [ ] Is my code sufficiently commented to allow others to understand its function?

**Reproducibility:**

-   [ ] For protocols: Have I ensured that all necessary details are included so that others can replicate the research exactly as it was performed?

-   [ ] For code: Have I listed all dependencies and libraries needed to run the code? Have I included sample data or test cases?

**Version Control:**

-   [ ] Is my code or protocol version-controlled, with a clear history of changes and updates?

-   [ ] Have I tagged important versions (e.g., version 1.0 for the code or protocol used in the published research)?

**Licensing:**

-   [ ] Have I selected an open-source license (e.g., MIT, GPL, CC-BY) that clearly specifies how my code or protocol can be reused and modified by others?

-   [ ] Is the license information clearly visible in the repository?

**Platform Selection:**

-   [ ] Have I selected an appropriate platform for sharing my code and protocols (e.g., GitHub, Zenodo, OSF, Protocols.io)?

-   [ ] Does the platform provide a DOI or persistent identifier to ensure proper citation and long-term accessibility?

**Ethical and Legal Compliance:**

-   [ ] Does my code or protocol comply with all relevant ethical guidelines, especially when handling sensitive data or materials?

-   [ ] Have I ensured that sharing my code or protocol does not infringe on intellectual property rights or violate any proprietary agreements?
