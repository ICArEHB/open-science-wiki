## Policy on Pre-Registrations

ICArEHB strongly encourages the use of pre-registration for research studies, particularly for hypothesis-driven research. Pre-registration is a powerful tool to improve research transparency, ensuring that analyses and outcomes are not adjusted after the data has been collected. Registrations and pre-registrations help protect the integrity of scientific findings by clearly documenting research plans before data collection or publication.

**Encouraged Pre-Registration**

All hypothesis-driven research conducted at ICArEHB should be pre-registered prior to data collection. Pre-registration provides a clear record of the planned hypotheses, methods, and analyses, preventing post-hoc adjustments.

**Mandatory Registration for Clinical Trials and High-Risk Research**

Research that involves clinical trials, human subjects, or high-risk areas (e.g., sensitive data, public health implications) must be registered on approved platforms to ensure full transparency and compliance with ethical standards.

**Transparency in Reporting**

Researchers must disclose their pre-registration or registration status in all related publications, ensuring that readers can verify that the study followed the pre-registered plans.

## What is Pre-Registration?

Pre-registration refers to the practice of documenting and timestamping the study design, hypotheses, and analysis plans before data collection begins. This method increases the credibility and transparency of research by making clear what the researcher intends to do before seeing the data.

Key elements of pre-registration include:

**Research Questions:** Clearly defining the research questions that will be addressed.

**Hypotheses:** Specifying the hypotheses that will be tested.

**Study Design and Methods:** Providing a detailed description of the study design, including the population, sample size, randomization procedures, and planned measurements.

**Analysis Plan:** Outlining the statistical analyses or qualitative methods that will be used to test the hypotheses.By pre-registering these components, researchers create a permanent, time-stamped record that can later be compared to the final study report to assess the fidelity of the research process.

### **Pre-Registration vs. Registration**

It is important to distinguish between pre-registration and registration:

**Pre-registration:** This occurs before data collection begins. It documents hypotheses, methods, and planned analyses, ensuring that researchers commit to a specific analysis plan upfront.

**Registration:** This happens after the study is completed but before the results are published. Registration involves documenting key details about the study and ensuring that the results are accessible to the public, even if they are not published in a traditional journal. Registration is often used for clinical trials or large-scale public health studies to ensure transparency.

## Benefits of Pre-Registration

Pre-registration offers several significant benefits for researchers and the broader scientific community:

-   **Prevents P-Hacking:** By specifying the hypotheses and analyses upfront, pre-registration helps prevent p-hacking, where researchers selectively report significant results or adjust their analyses to achieve desirable outcomes.

-   **Increases Transparency:** Pre-registration creates a publicly accessible record of the study design, ensuring that research findings can be evaluated in the context of the original plan. This increases accountability and trust in the research process.

-   **Promotes Reproducibility:** Pre-registration facilitates reproducibility by providing a clear, detailed record of the research plan. Other researchers can replicate the study or use the original design to inform their own research.

-   **Encourages Clearer Study Design:** Pre-registering forces researchers to carefully think through their study design, hypotheses, and analysis plan, leading to more thoughtful and well-designed studies.

## Steps for Pre-Registration

A full tutorial on how to create a pre-registration at OSF is [available here](https://help.osf.io/article/158-create-a-preregistration). Overall, ICArEHB researchers should follow these steps to successfully pre-register their studies:

-   **Develop Your Study Design:** Define your research questions, hypotheses, and methods. Carefully plan out how you will collect and analyze your data.

-   **Choose a Platform for Pre-Registration:** Select a pre-registration platform that suits your research needs (e.g., [OSF Registrations](https://osf.io/registries), see [this link](https://osf.io/sgrk6/) for a tutorial).

-   **Submit Your Study Plan:** Complete the pre-registration form, detailing your hypotheses, methodology, and analysis plans. Be as specific as possible to ensure that your study can be evaluated transparently.

-   **Time-Stamp and Make It Public:** Once submitted, ensure that your pre-registration is time-stamped and publicly accessible (unless proprietary reasons prevent public sharing).

**Update as Necessary:** If your study plan changes, update your pre-registration and document any deviations from the original plan in the final report. Transparency about changes is just as important as the original plan.

## Checklist for Pre-Registration

Before conducting your study, use the following checklist to ensure that your pre-registration process is complete:

**Study Design:**

-   [ ] Have I clearly defined my research questions and hypotheses?

-   [ ] Have I outlined a detailed plan for data collection, including the population, sample size, and measurement tools?

**Analysis Plan:**

-   [ ] Have I specified the statistical or qualitative analysis methods that I will use to test my hypotheses?

-   [ ] Have I outlined how I will handle outliers, missing data, or any other issues that may arise during analysis?

**Platform Selection:**

-   [ ] Have I selected the appropriate platform for pre-registration (e.g., OSF)?

-   [ ] Have I reviewed the platform's guidelines to ensure that my pre-registration is compliant?

**Time-Stamping and Public Access:**

-   [ ] Have I ensured that my pre-registration is time-stamped and made publicly accessible?

-   [ ] If there are restrictions on public access, have I documented the reasons?

**Reporting and Deviations:**

-   [ ] Am I prepared to disclose my pre-registration status in any resulting publications?

-   [ ] If deviations from the original plan occur, am I ready to document and explain these changes transparently?
