# 10. Preprints {.unnumbered}

Preprints are early versions of research papers that have not yet undergone peer review or been published in a scientific or academic journal. They are typically posted on preprint servers, which are online repositories that allow authors to share their work with the wider research community before publication.

Preprints often contain preliminary results or research findings that are still being refined or validated. They are intended to facilitate the dissemination of research findings and enable early feedback and collaboration among researchers.

Preprints are becoming increasingly popular in many scientific disciplines, including physics, biology, computer science, and archaeology. They offer several benefits, such as faster dissemination of research, increased collaboration opportunities, and the ability to receive feedback from a wider range of experts in the field.

### **Why publish preprints?**

There are several reasons why researchers choose to publish preprints:

-   Rapid dissemination of research findings: Preprints enable researchers to share their work quickly and easily with the wider scientific community, leading to more rapid dissemination of research findings.

-   Increased visibility and impact: By making their research available as a preprint, researchers can increase the visibility and impact of their work, as it can be accessed and cited by other researchers before it is formally published.

-   Early feedback and collaboration: Preprints allow researchers to receive early feedback and engage in collaborative discussions with other experts in their field, which can help to improve the quality of their research.

-   Avoidance of long review processes: Formal peer review can be a lengthy and time-consuming process. Publishing preprints can reduce the time from submission to publication, as it enables researchers to receive feedback and make revisions before submitting their work to a journal.

-   Open science and transparency: Publishing preprints is part of a growing movement towards open science and transparency in research, which aims to make scientific findings more accessible to the public and increase trust in scientific research.

### **Where to publish preprints?**

Preferably a preprint server that provides a persistent identifier. For example:

-   [OSF Preprints](https://osf.io/preprints/): you can choose many preprint servers and can also share supplementary files. A list of preprint servers hosted via OSF Preprints can be found [here](https://osf.io/preprints/discover?subject=bepress%7CSocial%20and%20Behavioral%20Sciences).

-   Directly via a preprint server, such as [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) or [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/)

-   You can even add a preprint on [ResearchGate](https://explore.researchgate.net/display/support/Preprints)!

### **Feedback and updating**

Researchers can give/receive feedback on preprints in different ways: - In OSF preprints, you can use their tool Hypothes.is to annotate preprints, see their [help guide](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019738554-annotate-a-preprint).

What you do with feedback is completely up to you. If you want, you can update your preprint to a new version. However, note that all versions are timestamped and retained. Often new versions get a new identifier (DOI) and old versions cannot be removed. If your work gets published by a publisher, many preprint servers also offer the possibility to refer to the identifier (DOI) of your published work, so that readers of the preprint get a notification that they are not reading the most up-to-date version.
