Sharing analysis code in research has several benefits, including:

-   Reproducibility: Sharing code allows other researchers to replicate your analysis and verify your findings. This is important because reproducibility is a fundamental aspect of scientific research.

-   Transparency: Sharing code makes your research more transparent by allowing others to see exactly how you conducted your analysis. This helps to build trust in your results and allows others to build upon your work.

-   Efficiency: Sharing code can save other researchers time and effort by allowing them to build upon your work instead of starting from scratch. This can lead to more rapid progress in a field of study.

-   Collaboration: Sharing code can facilitate collaboration between researchers by allowing them to easily share their work and build upon each other's ideas.

-   Education: Sharing code can be a valuable educational resource for students and other researchers who are interested in learning new techniques or methods.

Overall, sharing analysis code in research can help to promote open science and advance the progress of scientific research.

Web-based technologies make it very easy to share these materials (and even to share the complete software environment using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) containers). However, just releasing your code without annotation is not very informative because others (and future you!) can't make a lot of sense of it. Two helpful tools to annotate your code are RMarkdown and Jupyter notebooks.

R Markdown and Jupyter notebooks are tools that allow researchers to create executable documents that combine code, text, and data. These tools make research more reproducible in several ways:

-   Documentation: R Markdown and Jupyter notebooks allow researchers to document their analysis in real-time, making it easier for others to understand the steps taken in the analysis.

-   Version control: These tools allow researchers to track changes to their analysis and code over time, making it easier to reproduce previous analyses and results.

-   Code sharing: R Markdown and Jupyter notebooks allow researchers to share their code and data with others, making it easier to reproduce their analysis.

-   Reproducibility: By combining code, text, and data in a single document, R Markdown and Jupyter notebooks make it easier for others to reproduce a researcher's analysis and results. This helps to ensure that research findings are accurate and reliable.

-   Collaboration: R Markdown and Jupyter notebooks make it easy for researchers to collaborate on an analysis, by allowing them to share and edit the same document.
